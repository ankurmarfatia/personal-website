                <p>It's a draw, it's a draw. But India should have won the first Test.</p>
                
                <p>We should have won, not because Pakistan went in with three inexperienced bowlers or that the Pakistani top-order is weak or Pakistan are a poor fielding side.</p>
                
                <p>But because all the Indian batsmen dominated, the Indian bowlers were able to skittle out the top-order and Pakistani fielders dropped catches left, right and centre.</p>
                
                <p>It was all going to script for the first four days, alas Test cricket is a five-day game and on the fifth day the determination of the opposition was much stronger than India's to get a favourable result.</p>
                
                <p>Virender Sehwag once again showed he is a very good player and the world needs to take notice of him. Sachin Tendulkar rubbished talk of being a spent force and put up a very good innings and so did VVS Laxman.</p>
                
                <p>For Pakistan, Kamran Akmal showed both teams that you can achieve anything if you have the stomach to fight and a strong head to stay disciplined.</p>
                
                <p>India will go into the next Test with a perennial question now: How can the opposition outclass them as far as determination to get a favourable result is concerned?</p>
