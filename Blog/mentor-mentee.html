                <p>A mentor draws your chariot to the middle of the battlefield to give you perspective. The battlefield could be a real one or one that life throws at you from time to time. At tough times in your life, a mentor puts their hand on your shoulder and explains the importance of continuing on irrespective of the results you see in your immediate future. They can do this because they have been exactly where you have been and have lived through what happens next. A mentor can assure you that if you keep going, you will either find success or, at the very least, gain valuable experience from failure—which will serve you well in the future. At times, a mentor will explain the importance of not getting too attached to the process and instead letting time take its course to deliver the results you seek at the exact time you deserve them. While you wait and fight for what is rightfully yours, a mentor explains a better method of improvement—one that involves daily identification and introspection, and ruthless elimination of inefficiencies so you can present a strong case for success in your desired path. At times of ambiguity, a mentor helps you find the correct path by looking within yourself for the light to guide you. This is the light that shapes your perspective of whatever you see, believe, and experience.</p>
                
                <p>Finding the right mentor can be a long process—it was for me. I started looking for a mentor with a simple criterion: to find someone who could guide me. Guide me at what? I didn't know. As I began with my first mentor, I assumed they would know what to guide me toward—after all, they had done it before. It didn't quite work out that way. We had some good conversations, I got some good tips about leadership, but one day I sat in the cafeteria waiting for them only to realize they were on vacation. The experience left me wondering about the value of having a mentor and whether the program actually worked.</p>
                
                <p>A few years passed and I had another mentor. This time, I was determined to make it work better. I was much more prepared to be a mentee. I was more open about my situation and clearer about the issues I wanted to deal with. I was able to find a good ear this time. The sessions, though, did not yield the progress I intended to achieve. I believe that could be attributed to our life experiences being very different.</p>
                
                <p>Circumstance played its part—I lost that mentor to retirement. That brought me to another mentor. This time around, I made my goal absolutely clear and set a timeline on it. I made sure to concentrate every meeting on the pre-established goal. This mentor had walked the path I wanted to tread—maybe not exactly, but close enough. Every meeting, we decided on certain actions I should take. Due to my nature, the encouragement provided by my mentor went a long way in helping me overcome my mental barriers to these actions. These various actions kept me on track for my goal and provided regular indicators of how far I had veered from the path—or if I was on track. This is not a story unique to myself.</p>
                
                <p>I have talked to a few people in the last two years and found similar experiences. Some relationships did not yield what they came seeking, and then they found the one mentor who took flight with them. Everyone has their own parameters, but in general, finding the right mentor is the primary responsibility of the mentee. They should have the mental clarity, the willingness to work toward a goal, and make sure they ask the right questions of the right person.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Finally, I found a good one. So can you.</strong></p>
