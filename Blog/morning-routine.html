                <p>My day starts at 4:30 am in the morning. I drag myself out of bed by 4:45. Get myself woken up and go downstairs to my kitchen to get breakfast ready.</p>
                
                <p>My breakfast could be a choice of protein smoothie with fruits—strawberry, raspberries, blueberries, pineapple, and sometimes bananas—or it could be the same fruits with warm oatmeal or Greek yogurt. I am a simple man; I stick to simple recipes. I make some pancakes for my son. I pack my lunch and munch while I am at it.</p>
                
                <p>Then I start my workout routine—either I'm out for a 5K run or, if the weather resembles what we have this week, I stick indoors and find something on Grokker to follow along.</p>
                
                <p>After the workout, I get myself ready for the long journey to the Delta offices, battling the morning traffic, hoping hopelessly it will be quicker than yesterday. It never is. It never is.</p>
                
                <p>After a productive day at the office working with the finest people I've known, I start the journey back—hoping hopelessly it won't be an hour and a half like yesterday. It always is. Maybe an hour and 15 minutes on my lucky day.</p>
                
                <p>Back at home, later than I hoped for, I spend time with my family, have an early dinner by 6:30–7, and after a bit more family time—or more realistically, checking my messages—I call it a day by 8:00pm.</p>
                
                <p>To some, my home setup might seem strange. It works for me. I am a morning person.</p>
                
                <p>I am no great cook, so I take my own sweet time chopping those fruits, decorating them in my bowls, mixing hemp seeds, chia seeds... Just the ingredients to make the pancake batter bring me so much joy. I've been doing this for two years now: eating well and exercising. And when I sat down to recall this morning routine from this blog—it made me even happier.</p>
                
                <p>The joy is further enhanced by the fact that building this morning routine wasn't easy. It wasn't that I woke up one day and decided this was going to be my routine and everything was hunky-dory from there onwards. I had a few starts and stops. It would get cold and I would stop, or we were all called back to the office, and then it felt like the day was too long to have a consistent morning routine like this. Every time I stopped, I thought: was it really worth starting again? A feeling I never had when it was going strong. I had to overcome this feeling of letting go of my healthy morning habits to build this routine. Now, even if I have an RFC all through the night and I sleep at 3 instead of waking up at 4 in the morning, I make sure when I do wake up, I take the time for the run and healthy breakfast so that the day after is easier.</p>
