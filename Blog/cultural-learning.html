                <h1>Turning an Enterprise into a Learning Organization</h1>
                <p class="post-date">Published: May 2022</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="post-content">
                <p>Over 60 years ago, when the then US President, John F Kennedy gave the "Moon speech", the words used were <em>"We meet in an hour of change and challenge, in a decade of hope and fear, in an age of both knowledge and ignorance. The greater our knowledge increases, the greater our ignorance unfolds."</em> Those words, somehow, reign true even today. It is as if he was talking about this day and this decade.</p>
                
                <h2>Why do we learn?</h2>
                <p>I have been to many conferences, both internal and external, heard many podcasts and talks, read plenty of books, and watched videos. There is exponential amount of knowledge out there, so many different things, so many different technologies, so many ways to use those technologies. If you were to ever reach a state where you master the technology and all the ways to use it, someone will surely produce a much more efficient way to use the same technology or fork it to create a new one.</p>
                
                <p>I can safely say, in grand scheme of things, I know nothing at all. I live in this perpetual state. I call myself a lifelong curious learner. Life I believe is journey of continuous learning with no destination, just milestones, and a long path ahead.</p>
                
                <h2>Why build a culture of learning?</h2>
                <p>I come from a company and a culture that puts its people first, and it shows. We are one of the very few companies that retain talent for multiple decades. Our employee turn-over even in these times of great resignation has been significantly lower than that of an average organization.</p>
                
                <p>Of course, nobody who was hired that many years ago, is still surviving on the skills they were originally hired for. It is important for our organization to keep our employees upskilled, because they have carried us through a lot of turbulent times, and will continue to do so, every time they are called upon.</p>
                
                <h2>Learning Buddy</h2>
                <p>The benefits of networking are very well documented, and those can be extended into learning as well. One of the best ways to spread knowledge is via sharing. Knowledge is a wealth that multiplies as you share.</p>
                
                <p>Most successful people in their field will tell you that they often share blogs, articles, industry publications between their close associates. Therefore, I believe in setting up a small network of friends and well-wishers, across whatever platform or medium you choose who you can privately recommend some article, whitepapers, blogs, videos, events even, helpful to them.</p>
                
                <h2>Bits and Bites</h2>
                <p>We all have some common ideas, some common problems. It is important to discuss these. Some of us have found a way to solve these a bit differently than others. A few of us are successful in solving these problems and a few of us have faced failure. All of us need to be heard.</p>
                
                <p>In our organization, we did not have a culture of people getting together for a regular discussion/learning cadence. We wanted to change that, bring people together, give them a forum to learn from each other. We conceived an idea for a weekly Developer knowledge exchange session.</p>
                
                <p>Seventy attended the first session, in a room that could hold just fifty. We have done it most Wednesdays from noon to one since then, members from all over our enterprise come together and present what they have been working on, how they have solved a complex problem or explain a modern technology that helped them solve an issue.</p>
                
                <h2>Learning Circle</h2>
                <p>Learning Circle is founded on the principles of:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><em>Tell me and I forget,<br>
                    Teach me and I remember<br>
                    Involve me and I learn.</em></p>
                </blockquote>
                
                <p>It makes learning a collective journey. Learning Circle provides a forum, where we can come together as peers and share knowledge and learning.</p>
                
                <p>Every 90-minute Learning Circle session follows a set pattern:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We begin with a nice little pre-quiz to judge the baseline understanding</li>
                    <li>Then we have an informative discussion on the Topic of the Day</li>
                    <li>We follow that up with an engaging hands-on activity to solidify our learning</li>
                    <li>Then its time for a post session quiz, which includes polling for future topics</li>
                    <li>We conclude with some Q&A and a promise to return for next session</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Everybody learns differently</h2>
                <p>While designing an Enterprise learning program, it is important to remember: One size does not fit all. Everybody learns at different pace, in diverse ways, in different settings. Some people like to learn by listening to sessions in person. Some like to watch videos. Some revel in hands on workshops, some like to watch recorded demos.</p>
                
                <p>If you still do not believe it, let me tell you a story that probably everybody knows about Sir Isaac Newton. The gravity was always there, it was probably not the first apple that fell from a tree. However, till that moment, had never found inspiration to find the connection to gravity. So, if it took Sir Isaac Newton a substantial portion of his life to figure it out, is it really an exaggeration to say some take time to digest the learning? Probably not.</p>
                
                <h2>Learning Paths</h2>
                <p>Like every other company these days Delta is in the middle of a Digital, Cloud and cultural transformation. The route Delta chose was to start creating learning paths for their people.</p>
                
                <p>The first step in this journey was to identify the core skills that were needed at our organization. Next was to identify roles team members would need to play. Once roles were identified, we put together a learning journey. We partnered with AWS, Red hat, and learning platforms like Percipio and Pluralsight to create a suggestive playlist of starter curriculum.</p>
                
                <h2>Bootcamps</h2>
                <p>Boot camps are a terrific way to build momentum towards learning and spread awareness about technology and the cultural transformation itself.</p>
                
                <p>Our bootcamps were day long sessions that ended up being roadshows between Atlanta and Minneapolis. We would start the sessions at 9am in the morning and they would run until 4pm. A typical day would comprise of lectures in the morning part of the session. After lunch, we would have a pre-setup lab activity, which would let our participants have a hands-on experience around what they had learnt in the morning.</p>
                
                <h2>Dojo</h2>
                <p>In Japanese culture a Dojo is a hall or a place for immersive learning or meditation. Our Dojo was focused on the immersive learning part.</p>
                
                <p>The idea was to bring in a preformed functioning team for a few weeks, 8 weeks, about four sprints, to a specially created area away from their daily rigor. In these 8 weeks, they would work with our coaches, specializing in various categories such as security, DevOps, cloud, API design, quality engineering, developer practice as well as specialized subjects such as design learning and architecture.</p>
                
                <h2>Hackathon - A Festival of Learning</h2>
                <p>There is something special about a Hackathon. The feel is quite different, very liberating. In our quest to build a learning culture and instill certain aspects of the transformation, we decided to take it a step further.</p>
                
                <p>Our Hackathon in October 2019, we made it into a festival. A festival of learning. We held our hackathon over a period of a week. While the hacker was trying to solve a problem the best way they could, we filled the day with couple of learning sessions too. The event was a grand success and is still talked about in the lobbies of Delta.</p>
                
                <h2>All-star Coaching</h2>
                <p>One of the keys to making any of the programs successful is leadership support. Most people follow their leaders. To start and build a learning culture, it is essential to start at the top.</p>
                
                <p>Our All-Star Coaching targets upper management all the way up to the VPs at Delta. Every VP at Delta IT has committed to a monthly session on one of the behavioral attributes, that we decided were essential to the roles we created for overall growth of our organization.</p>
                
                <h2>In Conclusion</h2>
                <p>Learning is a never-ending journey. It helps to be mindful not everybody starts from the same place, at the same time. It is best to meet them where they are and when they are ready to get onboard. Everybody takes a different amount of time to hit each milestone, so no learners are the same. Learning programs need to be developed accordingly.</p>
                
                <p>Knowledge grows by sharing. If you are in a learning culture, you know progress will be made.</p>
                
                <p><em>This was our learning culture story, we tried a few things, some were more successful than others. Some worked better for us than it would for you, others would work better for you, than it did for us.</em></p>
