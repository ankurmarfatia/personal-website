Leadership Journey: Lessons in Growth and Transformation
One piece of leadership advice I’ll never forget came from a former manager and a book I once read:
“Emulate what you admired in others’ leadership, and leave behind what you didn’t.”
Since then, I’ve been keenly observing leaders—learning from their successes and shortcomings. I’ve also drawn insights from books, talks, and articles. My approach to this project was simple: Let’s see what the Toastmasters manual says, but I’ll do it my way. And I’m comfortable with that.

Leadership Styles in Action
Over the years, I’ve experienced and embodied various leadership styles:

In 2017, after a long tenure with Deltacomm, I transitioned to the DevTools team—then part of Ennon. The team was primarily composed of System Engineers, while I had spent my career as a Developer. Our goal was to bridge both worlds and usher in a new era of DevOps and Development Practices. My prior research on DevOps helped me lead this transformation.

Building Trust Across Borders
In 2010, Delta began working with Global Delivery Partners—teams split between Atlanta and India. The group was young and relatively inexperienced. I quickly noticed a lack of trust between the teams, which led to frequent arguments, rework, and delivery delays. The absence of strong management added to the stress, especially for the team lead. I stepped in with clear feedback, guidance, and a focus on personal accountability. Eventually, we completed the project successfully.

Volunteering and Leading with Purpose
I’ve served as Vice President of Education in volunteer organizations and supported multiple groups both within and outside Delta. What I’ve learned is that while hierarchies exist, they often take a backseat in volunteer settings. Leaders bring their own styles and generously donate their time. In such environments, I’ve had the opportunity to drive enterprise-wide change.

Driving Change Through Upskilling
In 2020, we embarked on our Zulu journey—a mission to migrate all applications from on-premise servers to AWS Cloud. This required significant upskilling. I led a diverse team, each member at a different career stage, with unique approaches and varying skill levels. To reach our goal, I worked individually with each team member to chart personalized learning paths. The journey had its challenges, but we persevered. Today, most of us are stronger and more capable because of it.

Mentorship and Growth
In a recent leadership assignment, I worked with a team member who initially wanted to take on everything. Feedback revealed he often failed to complete tasks. Over time, I helped him find his niche. I asked him what he truly wanted to do and listened carefully. When we explored what he had done to achieve those goals, he realized the disconnect. We then focused on what he genuinely enjoyed about his work. From that point on, he began contributing meaningfully and became a valuable asset to the team.

Closing Reflections
I wasn’t bound by the slides running in the background—I adapted and blended in as needed. I did it my way. While preparing this, I realized I’ve only scratched the surface of this topic. If the opportunity arises, I’d love to deliver a longer talk on it in the future.

Thank you for joining me on this journey.
