                <p>In the year 1064, the good people of a small city in Italy decided that just like the rest of the Roman Empire, their city should have an iconic cathedral. One where they could worship as well as one that could serve as a place for the community to gather. The city council set out a budget to get the construction started. The ambitious project included designs for a marble structure, with a beautiful dome and a mosaiced floor. Along with the dome representing the heavens, the floor represented the earth. Once the plans were laid out, the city council members decided to build a basilica right next to it. This would be the place where children were baptized and adults could be married.</p>

                <p>As construction began on both, people were concerned. Every cathedral in Rome and Venice had a beautiful bell tower, but their own did not. An architect was called and a tall bell tower with 5 bells no less was decided to be erected. As years went by, the cathedral, basilica, and the bell tower were slowly taking shape. The bell tower, being a lot simpler structurally, finished first and looked marvelous.</p>

                <p>A few more years went by and the construction on the exterior of the basilica and cathedral still remained incomplete, and the city ran out of money. There was a city council meeting called to get a fresh budget. The people argued the cathedral and basilica were important to the people of the city and deserved to be completed. The council however decided the bell tower was completed, looked beautiful and was popular. It needed some structural fixes and so the budget for the basilica and cathedral would get limited. People were enterprising and decided, if they did not have the budget to fund new marble, they would reuse marble from ruins from neighboring cities to complete the cathedral and basilica.</p>

                <p>A few more years passed and that budget too was exhausted. The construction on the exterior of the basilica and cathedral still remained incomplete. Once again a city council meeting was called. The people argued the basilica and cathedral were very important to them culturally and spiritually and they should be completed. The council the bell tower looked beautiful and was popular, it needed some structural fixes and so the budget for the Basilica and the Cathedral was limited. The people were enthusiastic and decided they would use brass objects from various areas around the region to decorate the exterior of the cathedral and Basilica since they did not have the funds to try marble.</p>

                <p>This story continued for years, decades, and centuries. I visited that city last month. The Basilica never got a roof. The cathedral had different marble and looked patchy.</p>

                <p>This city is very close to the Mediterranean Sea. The land is soft. When they built the Belltower, the ground couldn't hold its weight and it started tilting. The city council did not want it to fall, so for about a millennium, they kept reinforcing parts, heaving weight at the right-hand side of the base, and making sure that the Leaning Tower of Pisa stayed tilted at a 3.97º angle—no more. People kept coming to see the miracle of the still standing Belltower and the city remained relevant for all this time. Purpose solved.</p>
