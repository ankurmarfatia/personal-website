                <p>Today, I'm here to writing about the DevSecOps World Tour by GitLab at TK Center, near the Braves Stadium and the networking that continued afterward at the Braves vs. Rockies game that evening.</p>
                
                <p>Networking .... Ya an interesting concept. Going out meeting people .... talking to them ... making new contacts ... very interesting. A lot of people from IT are introverts. This makes this simple sounding concept much more complicated, which is why I try to be at a Toastmaster Club every Thursday—to develop confidence.</p>
                
                <p>The event showcased GitLab's newer capabilities and featured users like us who've incorporated it into our daily work. My specific goals for the networking event were:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>To learn about GitLab's new features—we've been on an older version for years due to circumstances, and we're planning major changes soon.</li>
                    <li>To understand trends in DevSecOps that other companies are adopting.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Speaking at the event gave me more than an elevator pitch—it gave me a head start in commanding attention. Being a speaker gave me a head start and an icebreaker for conversations. I was able to walk up to many people, introduce myself, and talk about what they were working on, how they did things differently or similarly to Delta, and the challenges they were facing. This was especially helpful in conversations with GitLab product managers working on new and upcoming features. We discussed the reasoning behind features, the work that went into them, and what to expect.</p>
                
                <p>One upcoming feature was very similar to something we've been developing at Delta. I understood why they chose a different path and now have a contact at GitLab for future collaboration. The exciting part of the day was knowing about the company a fellow speaker was leading. It was a startup by name of Hermena. It is a company which is experimenting in supersonic air travel. When successful, this kind of networking can drastically reduce barriers and improve collaboration.</p>
                
                <p>As the day wore on, conversations shifted from business to common interests, acquaintances, and shared experiences. We discussed heritage, favorite restaurants in Atlanta, and more. I also met a gentleman from Hungary who was delighted to know I could hop on a plane and visit any country since I worked for Delta. He even offered to send me a list of activities my son would love. He followed through and sent the list a few days later—very considerate of him.</p>
                
                <p>My primary intention was to meet people from outside Delta. To my surprise, several developers from Tech Ops were also present. It was the first time I met them in person. We discussed roadblocks they were facing, and they were delighted to learn my team had a solution that could be immediately applied. They promised to reciprocate with a private tour of the Tech Ops Center, which I've never visited.</p>
                
                <p>As is the norm, I sent LinkedIn invites to many people I met. Some accepted, some are pending. I wouldn't call these solid connections yet, but it's a start.</p>
                
                <p><strong>In conclusion, I went into the networking event with a certain mindset but got much more interesting conversations than I expected.</strong></p>
