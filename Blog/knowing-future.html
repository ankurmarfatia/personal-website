                <p>India is famous for making big mega-movies. One such movie— actually made in two parts— was Bahubali. The story is about a prince orphaned at birth, loved by his aunt, but whose uncle and cousin want to keep the kingdom for themselves.</p>
                
                <p>Both kids grow up together and learn the art of fighting from the chief of the army, Katappa. The relationship between Bahubali and Katappa is very close. However, at the end of the first movie, we are left with a cliffhanger and a question:</p>
                
                <blockquote>
                    <p><em>"Katappa ne Bahubali ko kyo mara?"<br>
                    (Why did Katappa kill Bahubali?)</em></p>
                </blockquote>
                
                <p>It's an obvious attempt to bring the audience back for the second movie.</p>
                
                <p>The second movie deals with the question by showing Katappa, being loyal to the kingdom, had to stall any attempt by Bahubali to win back the crown from his evil uncle and cousin. However, to answer the question, maybe we look deeper into Hindu mythology.</p>
                
                <p>Let's go back to Krishna... ...and Kansa.</p>
                
                <p>Kansa was an evil king of Mathura who loved his sister Devaki. However, on the day of his beloved sister's wedding, there was a foretelling. The skies spoke, the Gods laughed at Kansa, and foretold that he would be killed by the eighth born son of Devaki and her new husband Vasudev. Kansa was furious and locked them up.</p>
                
                <p>When Vasudev and Devaki had their first child, Kansa decided he didn't want to take any chances. He would kill each and every child the couple had.</p>
                
                <p>When the eighth child arrived, it was an incarnation of God. God works in mysterious ways, and so the child found his way out of prison and to Gokul village nearby. Kansa was furious.</p>
                
                <p>As days went by, Kansa realized a newborn in Gokul was the one he was destined to die at the hands of. Kansa employed an army of evil doers over the next decade and a half to attack this child and prevent his death. He was unsuccessful, with all his attempts failing miserably.</p>
                
                <p>At the end, Kansa met his death when he invited Krishna with the intention to kill him himself.</p>
                
                <p>Now let's think about this: What did the foretelling do to Kansa? Was locking up Devaki and Vasudev together the best idea?</p>
                
                <p>Kansa knew it would be the eighth born, so he had time—probably more than two decades—to mend his ways and ask for forgiveness from the Gods. However, he became more and more evil over time. Did that help?</p>
                
                <p>If the Gods wanted to kill him for his evil being, wouldn't they be able to do it with the first born? Did the Gods give him 20 years to get to a level of evil where his death was the only option? Had Kansa not known, is it possible he would have loved his nephew as much as he loved his sister?</p>
                
                <p>Is it possible if he had mended his ways, Kansa's death would have been a just reward for serving the Lord? Similarly, if Bahubali knew Katappa would kill him, maybe instead of being the hero everybody loved, he would become an evil prince!</p>
                
                <p>I think Katappa killed Bahubali because... Bahubali had a good life, enjoyed a good relationship, without ever knowing Katappa would be the true cause of his death.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Knowing the future is not all that it is made out to be—so be careful what you wish for.</strong></p>
