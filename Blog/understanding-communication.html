                <p>There is a lot of research that goes into communication styles, for a long period of time and especially now. The reason for this I believe, and the only thing that matters at every stage of true studies is: Can two people understand each other? Now I use "2 people" very loosely, across the internet—it's me and you communicating individually, irrespective of who else is present.</p>
                
                <p>2½ years ago, when I took the Toastmaster's assessment for the first time, I was an analytical communicator. I wanted to understand the "why" and communicate it. I preferred to break things down and understand the logic and learning behind it. In hindsight, I can say that the primary role I played at that time in Delta's digital transformation involved evaluating tools, technologies, organizing, and attending knowledge sessions, building the roadmap for the future. This was the correct primary form of communication style I should have practiced.</p>
                
                <p>A few things have changed since. Delta's digital transformation is nearing a major milestone and end of a chapter. I have taken up a different role. Though I consider myself to be a lifelong analytical person, I do not always communicate as such in my current situation. As I have researched leadership styles and grown as a leader, I have learned that one key attribute of leadership communication is to listen more and speak less—from 50% in a 1-to-1 conversation and much less in a group conversation with my team. I now practice primarily a supportive style of communication where I encourage ideas, suggestions, and discussion from the root. That doesn't mean I sit quietly in a room listening all day, letting the conversation go anywhere it ends up going. Sometimes that is required too.</p>
                
                <p>However, my secondary communication style is direct. This style helps me set an agenda as to what I would like to have happen for the group—a solution that needs to be worked on or an end result we would like to achieve as a team.</p>
                
                <p>On pondering further, I feel like all these 3 styles end up looking and feeling very formal. There is not much spontaneity, not much fun in my communication style. I always wonder how some people with this instinctive communication style do it? A couple of people reading this can do it. My wife certainly exhibits this style. She is very sociable, she loves to talk, and can talk on any subject. She can tell you a long-form story about everything. I can't do that.</p>
                
                <p>Sometimes listening to her story is very relaxing and I get lost in it, while sometimes, due to my preferred communication styles, I am going in my head: "Get to the point, get to the point." Must say, sometimes it's not just in my head—and those are the days I get sent to the dog house to directly analyze how I can be more supportive.</p>
                
                <p>Thank you.</p>
