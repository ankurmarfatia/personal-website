                <p>Non-revenue travel is a great benefit at Delta. You can decide on the spot to go somewhere and fly away, sometimes just for a day trip. On one such trip, I discovered something—something I've never discussed with anyone before. I don't want to get into trouble, so I'll ask you to keep this to yourself.</p>
                
                <p>On a day trip to the nation's capital, I visited the Smithsonian Museum. I went alone, as my family was visiting India at the time. The museum was overcrowded, and like many visitors, most people were just checking a box rather than truly engaging with the exhibits. In the center of the exhibition on U.S. space exploration, there was a notebook discovered from Neil Armstrong. It clearly mentioned a moon puppy—a lunar native animal that he brought back to Earth in 1969.</p>
                
                <p>The creature was small, had a tiny tail, and liked bouncing around on the lunar surface. Armstrong instantly fell in love with it and arranged for permission to bring it back. NASA was hesitant, but Armstrong insisted.</p>
                
                <p>Once the little creature came to Earth, Armstrong found it lying dormant for long periods of time and shrinking in size. At first, he thought it was due to the adjustment to its new home or his own busy schedule as a celebrity. But over time, even with more attention, the moon pup kept shrinking. It was no longer the bouncy little creature, but a helpless being unable to move. Gravity on Earth is six times that on the Moon, so the creature had to exert six times the effort to move. This led to weight loss and fatigue, explaining its condition. After a few days, Armstrong discovered that moon pups multiply by binary fission. He was now a dad to not just one, but multiple tiny moon pups, scattered all over his house—small and dormant.</p>
                
                <p>At this point, NASA intervened, and Armstrong gave the creatures to the U.S. government. The government had a different idea. They renamed the creatures moon tar. In experiments, they discovered that moon tar could withstand extreme heat and had atomic traits that helped with binary fission. Today, when new roads are created, the hard tar used to bind the roads contains a secret ingredient: moon tar.</p>
                
                <p><strong>This is a true story of why roads in the U.S. are more durable and have fewer potholes than anywhere else in the world. Please don't share this information with anyone else.</strong></p>
