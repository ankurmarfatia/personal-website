            <div class="post-content">
                <p>I recently accepted a job as Manager of Retail API, which is quite different from my previous role and requires understanding a new concept. Understanding a new concept requires research, and presenting it here in front of a friendly audience will help reinforce my understanding. My primary research included documents from the International Air Transport Association (IATA) website, conversations with my new manager, and discussions with business partners. My goal is to give you a high-level understanding of the topic without being too technical—though I may have slipped in a few terms, since that is my primary skill.</p>
                
                <p>The topic is New Distribution Capability (NDC).</p>
                
                <p>If we were Amazon, we'd offer a book in new or used condition, hardcover or paperback, at various price points. Since we are Delta, the equivalent is booking, seat selection, priority boarding—any combination of services. An order is simply what the customer is willing to accept and how we secure it for them.</p>
                
                <h2>So what is NDC?</h2>
                <p>As you may have guessed, it's a program supported and developed by IATA since September. It involves a set of messages exchanged via XML (Extensible Markup Language) between airlines and travel agencies. It's not limited to them—any third party, including non-IATA members, can use it.</p>
                
                <h2>Why have this program?</h2>
                <p>Airlines invest heavily in branding—like Delta One for business class—but when products are displayed on travel agency websites, that branding is lost. It becomes an opaque shopping experience.</p>
                
                <h2>Enter NDC.</h2>
                <p>It allows greater flexibility when working with GDS (Global Distribution Systems) and content aggregators before presenting offers to customers. Today, airlines are restricted by old technology. For example, pricing classes are limited to 26 alphabet letters, which is very restrictive. If a customer wants to move from one level to another, say from $100 to $150, that's a big jump. What if we wanted to offer a $5 or $10 upgrade for a specific market profile? Currently, that's not possible. Products are rigid—if you buy a certain class of ticket, you get a bundle: premium seat, food, priority boarding. But what if the customer is a Sky Club member traveling light and wants to maximize lounge time. Can we decouple the offer? No.</p>
                
                <p>NDC can solve that problem by enabling dynamic products and pricing, layered on top of what we file with GDS, offering customizable experiences. Some airlines have used NDC to reduce their own costs and dependence on GDS. Though there were early fears that GDS would become redundant, airlines have used NDC to enforce surcharges and boost their bottom line. Delta, however, has taken a tortoise approach—slow and steady—building a strategy around NDC to prioritize revenue gain over short-term profit. The strategy is to highlight Delta's differences and increase our competitive advantage. I hope this short peek into NDC has made you curious and excited, just like I am.</p>
